# Careium focus day: Proactive care

This is the result of the Careium focus day where one work day was spent
producing an innovative proof of concept with focus on proactive care.

## The problem

Seniors with age related memory loss or dementia commonly suffers from stress  
and anxiety. In assisted living facilities, the environment and staff can seem  
unfamiliar to a person living with such conditions and can further enhance  
negative feelings. A specific cause of stress is the lack of communication tools  
with family or the cognitive and/or physical abilities to use such tools.

## Our solution
We propose a one-way communication tool comprised of a server that can receive  
emails from family members and serve the latest message to a requesting client.  
The clients are a micro computers running a web application which shows the  
latest message from the family member alongside their picture.  
We hypothesize that such a device with a friendly message or a notice about a  
planned visit could remedy a spurt of anxiety when read.
